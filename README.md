### Color Reference

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Header Text Color |  #ffffcc (Light Yellow)|
| Header Background Color | #011f3d (Dark Blue)|
| Footer Text Color |  #ffffcc (Light Yellow)|
| Footer Background Color | #011f3d (Dark Blue)|


* These color choices result in a contrasting combination, with light yellow text on a dark blue background for both the header and footer sections of the website. This combination can create a visually appealing and impactful design.

### Typography

The font-family 'Arial', sans-serif is a commonly used font combination for web typography. It specifies that the preferred font for the text should be Arial, a sans-serif font.

Using a sans-serif font like Arial can provide a clean and modern look to the typography on my website. It is a widely available font that is easy to read on various screen sizes and devices.

By specifying 'sans-serif' as a fallback option, we ensure that if Arial is not available on a user's device, the browser will automatically select a similar sans-serif font as a backup.

Overall, the font-family 'Arial', sans-serif is a reliable choice for web typography, offering readability and compatibility across different platforms
