### Typography

The font-family 'Arial', sans-serif is a commonly used font combination for web typography. It specifies that the preferred font for the text should be Arial, a sans-serif font.

Using a sans-serif font like Arial can provide a clean and modern look to the typography on my website. It is a widely available font that is easy to read on various screen sizes and devices.

By specifying 'sans-serif' as a fallback option, we ensure that if Arial is not available on a user's device, the browser will automatically select a similar sans-serif font as a backup.
